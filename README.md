# Foxus
## A Tool for Focus.

### Motivation
As a Youtube Software Engineer, I understand the internet is a distracting place. Largely because of engineers like me, whose primary success metrics are to increase watchtime and page views.

I've noticed my attention span starting to decrease and I decided to try some Chrome Extensions to reset my focus. However, I've found many extensions to be difficult to use and personalize. So I decied to write my own -- **Foxus**.

Foxus is designed to remedy two major internet vices I have: Youtube recommendations, and the Facebook newsfeed.

### YouTube
When I go to Youtube I generally have a purpose -- a funny video recommened by a friend, a tutorial to watch, or a channel to catch up on. Too often to I venture to Youtube only to be distracted by the tantalizing recommended videos on the homepage:

* "Yes, I would like to know what happens in a block hole!"
* "Intro to Prime Number Theory, sign me up!"
* "What is the Federal Reserve?"

As you can see, YouTube has really figured me out. But no more!

I realized that I largely get distracted by thumbnails of YouTube videos. So I turned those off. This extension periodically goes through the DOM and sets all image sources to nil. However, if I want to see the quality of a video I can hover over and watch the GIF summary to make sure I've found the right video.

### Facebook
The Facebook newsfeed is great at sucking my time. It's too easy to slightly scroll down to see the next article again, and again, and again. So fuck it. I'm not going back.

Whenever I try to go to my newsfeed the browser will simply redirect to my profile. Problem Solved!
